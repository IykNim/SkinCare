  <h2>An Overview of Hair Types</h2><br>
  <p>There are 4 general hair types: straight (type 1), wavy (type 2), curly (type 3), and coily (type 4). Each is then further divided into subtypes (1A, 1B, and so on) based on the hair‚Äôs specific pattern, coarseness, and the tightness or looseness of any curls or coils.</p>
  <br>
  <i>Type 1 : Straight</i>
  <p>Type 1 hair is predominantly straight (and tends to look very sleek and shiny as a result). Because type 1 hair lacks curls and waves, natural oils flow from the scalp to the ends‚Äîwhich ensures that each strand gets enough nutrients but may also cause the hair to get oily faster than other types. Type 1 hair also appears to grow the fastest, but in reality, that‚Äôs because there‚Äôs no shrinkage (as opposed to curly or coily hair, which appears to ‚Äúshrink‚Äù when it‚Äôs really just curling up). Straight hair is more difficult to style because it doesn‚Äôt hold curls or textures well.</p>
  <b>Type 1 hair consists of: </b>
  <ul>
    <li>1A: Fully straight hair that‚Äôs fine, wispy, and very sleek.</li>
    <li>1B: Fully straight hair with some volume and thickness.</li>
    <li>1C: Mostly straight hair with occasional bends or waves.</li>
  </ul>
  <b>To care for type 1 hair: </b>
  <ul>
    <li>Use a hairbrush with natural bristles so you can carry your scalp‚Äôs natural oils along each strand.</li>
    <li>Use shampoo and hair masks to keep your hair from getting too oily.</li>
    <li>Use texturizing spray or dry shampoo before styling your hair, and apply hairspray to lock in styles.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <i>Type 2 : Wavy</i>
  <p>Type 2 hair is wavy‚Äîwith more waves and bends than type 1 hair but not as much curl as types 3 or 4 (which makes it fall somewhere between straight and curly). Most type 2 hair has S-shaped patterns, with each wave and curl getting more prominent the further it gets from the root. It‚Äôs also prone to frizzing, especially when exposed to humidity, and may even look different based on the weather. Overall, type 2 hair is thicker than type 1, with more bounce and volume.</p>
  <b>Type 2 hair consists of: </b>
  <ul>
    <li>2A: Tousled, loose waves that are less defined and easy to style.</li>
    <li>2B: Pronounced S-shaped waves that curl more as they get further from the scalp.</li>
    <li>2C: Voluminous, well-defined S-shaped waves that are especially prone to frizz.</li>
  </ul>
  <b>To care for type 2 hair: </b>
  <ul>
    <li>Squeeze-dry your hair with a soft t-shirt or hair towel (instead of rubbing it).</li>
    <li>Use a moisturizing, anti-frizz shampoo or leave-in treatment.</li>
    <li>Avoid touching your hair to prevent frizzing.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <i>Type 3 : Curly</i>
  <p>Type 3 hair features curls with more volume and body than types 1 or 2. Strands are mostly curled, although some might be S-shaped. Type 3 hair has plenty of natural definition and some sheen; it usually lies flat when wet and curls up as it dries. It‚Äôs also more prone to dryness than previous types because your scalp‚Äôs natural oils can‚Äôt travel down individual strands easily, and it‚Äôs also more prone to heat and breakage‚Äîso all type 3 hair tends to need moisture in order to stay healthy.</p>
  <b>Type 3 hair consists of: </b>
  <ul>
    <li>3A: Loose, bouncy curls roughly the size of sidewalk chalk.</li>
    <li>3B: Tight, dense ringlets roughly as wide as a marker.</li>
    <li>3C: Dense, voluminous corkscrew curls around the size of a pencil.</li>
  </ul>
  <b>To care for type 3 hair: </b>
  <ul>
    <li>Try not to heat-style your hair too often since it can damage your curls.</li>
    <li>Consider using heatless styles, or protective styles like buns and twist-outs to protect your hair.</li>
    <li>Use plenty of anti-frizz and moisturizing products in your daily haircare routine.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <i>Type 4 : Coily</i>
  <p>Coily hair features the tightest curls of all hair types. It‚Äôs heavily textured (e.g., tight coils, zig-zag patterns, etc.) and super dense, with lots of versatility in terms of styling! However, it needs lots of moisture to maintain, and it tangles easily because each strand of hair has so much texture. It also damages easily because, like type 3, it‚Äôs harder for natural oils to travel from the scalp to the ends of each strand‚Äîwhich is why type 4 hair needs to be nourished and cared for without being washed too frequently!</p>
  <b>Type 4 hair consists of: </b>
  <ul>
    <li>4A: Defined S-shaped coils roughly the size of a chopstick.</li>
    <li>4B: Tight, Z-shaped coils with less definition than 4A hair.</li>
    <li>4C: Sharp, extremely small Z-shaped strands with the least definition.</li>
  </ul>
  <b>To care for type 4 hair: </b>
  <ul>
    <li>Moisturize your hair often to keep it from getting dry.</li>
    <li>Consider using twists or braids to keep your hair out of your face.</li>
    <li>Try a protective style like crochet braids or box braids, especially for 4B or 4C.</li>
  </ul>
